# Mario HTML5 Updated/Hacked:
A Mario HTML 5 "Hacked" Client.

To be fair its really just a copy of the original [https://github.com/robertkleffner/mariohtml5] that is being updated now.

To use just run the "main.html" file.

# Controls:
Jump - S

Ability - A

Left - Left Arrow

Right - Right Arrow

Crouch - Down Arrow

????? - H

# Client/Server Communication
Currently the client will talk to the server about version control. *This is a project with a lot of errors that requires updates a lot* The server will send information about the version to the client and the client will decide to update or not.

We don't send any information about you or anything related to the server. To find what the server sends the client you can go to [http://deadclubgame.com/Mario/realmario.js].

> In the future I might add an option to turn client server communication off.

# Credit:
I take no credit for this as the original project was NOT my own, I am simply adding my own features to it.
