# Mario HTML5 Updated/Hacked:
A Mario HTML 5 "Hacked" Client.

To be fair its really just a copy of the original [https://github.com/robertkleffner/mariohtml5] that is being updated now. Updates include better hacks, texture changes, better interface, Client/Server communication *More in the "Client/Server Communication" area* and a ton more. Remember; When a new release comes out the older versions will not function correctly or will require an update to continue.

To use just run the "main.html" file.

# Controls:
Jump - S

Ability - A

Left - Left Arrow

Right - Right Arrow

Crouch - Down Arrow

Hacks - H | **Will Be Removed In 2.6**

# Client/Server Communication
Currently the client will talk to the server about version control. *This is a project with a lot of errors that requires updates a lot* The server will send information about the version to the client and the client will decide to update or not.

We don't send any information about you or anything related to the server. To find what the server sends the client you can go to [http://deadclubgame.com/Mario/realmario.js].

> In the future I might add an option to turn client server communication off.
